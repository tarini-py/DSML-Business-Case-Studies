# Jamboree Education - Linear Regression

This project builds a data-driven system to predict a student’s **probability of admission** to graduate programs using academic and profile features. The goal is not only accurate prediction, but also extracting **actionable business insights** for education consulting companies like *Jamboree Education*.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Education consultants need to:

- Estimate a student’s admission chances reliably  
- Identify the **most impactful profile factors**  
- Guide students on where to invest effort (GRE, CGPA, research, etc.)  
- Optimize counseling resources

This project solves all four using regression modeling and statistical analysis.

---

## 📊 Dataset Overview

Features used:

- GRE Score  
- TOEFL Score  
- University Rating  
- SOP Strength  
- LOR Strength  
- CGPA  
- Research Experience  
- Target: Chance of Admit (0–1)

---

## ⚙️ Methodology

- Data cleaning & EDA  
- Feature scaling  
- Linear Regression using `scikit-learn`  
- Model validation using:
  - R²  
  - Adjusted R²  
  - RMSE  
  - MAE  
- Assumption checks:
  - Multicollinearity (VIF)
  - Residual analysis
  - Heteroscedasticity tests

---

## 🚀 Model Performance

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| R² (Test) | ~0.819 |
| Adjusted R² | ~0.818 |
| RMSE | ~0.061 |
| MAE | ~0.043 |

✅ Strong predictive accuracy  
✅ Stable generalization (no overfitting)  
✅ Production-ready baseline model
